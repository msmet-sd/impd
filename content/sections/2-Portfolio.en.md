    content: "Vicki Reece has been passionately connecting with women and moms globally around all that matters most to them. It began back when her children were young – when violent toys were all the rage. And irresponsible messages were marketed to children. Not one to sit on the sidelines, Vicki saw a need to create positive entertainment + educational products for kids. The kind moms wanted and children needed. That inspired and encouraged self-esteem, acceptance, and empathy – rather than tearing them down. With virtually zero resources, experience or know how, Vicki created best-selling children’s products through pure grit and grass-roots. Moms wanted more and Vicki listened and took action every step of the way. 10 years in the making. At Joy of Mom, we come together – we mobilize – for the greater good. ",
